#' The European Consumer Satisfaction Index (ECSI) is an economic indicator that
#' measures customer satisfaction. ECSI is an adaptation of the Swedish Customer
#' Satisfaction Barometer (Fornell, 1992) and is compatible with the American
#' Customer Satisfaction Index.  The indicators describing the latent variables
#' are given for the Mobile Phone Industry. The original items scaled from 1 to 10
#' have been transformed into new normalized variables. The minimum possible value
#' of each variable is 0 and its maximum possible value is equal to 10.
