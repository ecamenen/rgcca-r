\usage{
select_analysis(
  blocks,
  connection = 1 - diag(length(blocks)),
  penalty = rep(1, length(blocks)),
  ncomp = rep(1, length(blocks)),
  scheme = "centroid",
  superblock = TRUE,
  method = "rgcca",
  verbose = TRUE,
  quiet = FALSE,
  response = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{blocks}{List of blocks.}

\item{connection}{Symmetric matrix (J*J) that describes the relationships
between blocks. Elements of the connection matrix must be positive ; but
usually equal to 1 if block \eqn{j} and block \eqn{k} are connected, and 0
otherwise.}

\item{penalty}{Vector of length J (or character string for 'optimal'
setting) indicating the values of the tuning parameters.}

\item{ncomp}{Vector of length J indicating the number of block components
for each block.}

\item{scheme}{Character string or a function giving the scheme function for
covariance maximization among "horst" (the identity function), "factorial"
 (the squared values), "centroid" (the absolute values). The scheme function
 can be any continously differentiable convex function and it is possible to
 design explicitely the sheme function (e.g. function(x) x^4) as argument of
 rgcca function.  See (Tenenhaus et al, 2017) for details.}

\item{superblock}{Boolean indicating the presence of the superblock.
Default = TRUE}

\item{method}{A character string indicating the multi-block component
method to consider: rgcca, sgcca, pca, spca, pls, spls, cca,
ifa, ra, gcca, maxvar, maxvar-b, maxvar-a, mcoa,cpca-1, cpca-2,
cpca-4, hpca, maxbet-b, maxbet, maxdiff-b, maxdiff, maxvar-a,
sabscor, ssqcor, ssqcor, ssqcov-1, ssqcov-2, ssqcov, sumcor,
sumcov-1, sumcov-2, sumcov, sabscov, sabscov-1, sabscov-2.}

\item{verbose}{Logical value indicating whether the warnings are displayed.}

\item{quiet}{Logical value indicating if warning messages are reported.}

\item{response}{Numerical value giving the position of the response block. When
the response argument is filled the supervised mode is automatically
activated.}
}
\value{
\item{blocks}{List of blocks.}

\item{scheme}{Character string or a function giving the scheme
function used for covariance maximization.}

\item{penalty}{Vector of length J (or character string for
'optimal' setting) indicating the values of the tuning parameters.}

\item{ncomp}{Vector of length J indicating the number of block
components or each block.}

\item{connection}{Symmetric matrix (J*J) that describes the
relationships between blocks.}

\item{superblock}{Logical value indicating if superblock is
included in the analysis.}
